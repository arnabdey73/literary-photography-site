      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Literary Photography was born from a simple belief: that the most powerful stories emerge when words and images dance together. This space exists at the intersection of literature and visual art, where each photograph carries a narrative and every story paints a picture.</p>
      
      <p>In a world increasingly divided between the written word and the visual medium, we believe there's profound beauty in their union. Here, you'll find literary works that may be accompanied by carefully chosen photographs, and photographic stories that speak as eloquently as any written piece.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #667eea; padding-left: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; font-style: italic; color: #4b5563; font-size: 1.125rem;">
        "Every photograph is a story waiting to be told, and every story is a world waiting to be seen."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>We believe that literature and photography are not competing forms of expression, but complementary languages that can amplify each other's impact. A photograph can illuminate the emotional landscape of a poem, while a well-crafted sentence can reveal layers of meaning in a visual composition.</p>

      <h2>About the Creator</h2>
      <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f9fafb 0%, #f3f4f6 100%); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
        <p>This project is the work of a writer and photographer who believes in the power of thoughtful, intentional content. With a background in both literary arts and visual storytelling, the goal is to create a space where these passions can coexist and enrich each other.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When not behind the camera or at the keyboard, you can find the creator exploring the quiet moments that often hold the most profound stories‚Äîwhether that's the way light falls across an old building, or the rhythm of words in an overheard conversation.</p>
      </div>
